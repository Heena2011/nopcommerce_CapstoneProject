🛒 NopCommerce Automation Testing Project

👩‍💻 Project Owner: Heena Mulani

This is a capstone QA & Automation project developed by me to demonstrate hands-on skills in manual and automation testing for a nopCommerce e-commerce application.
The project includes:
Automation of core pages using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG
Manual test cases (50+) written in Excel
Presentation explaining framework design and test strategy

🎯 Project Objectives

Automate key workflows of nopCommerce using Page Object Model (POM)
Design, write, and maintain manual test cases for functional and regression testing
Implement test planning, data management, and reporting
Showcase ability to handle both manual and automated QA processes

🖥️ Automated Pages

I have automated the following pages using Selenium + TestNG:
-Page	Automated Test Scenario
-Registration Page	User registration validations
-Login Page	User login validations
-Home Page	Homepage elements and navigation checks
-Search Page	Product search functionality
-Add to Cart Page	Adding items to cart
-Checkout Page	Checkout workflow
-Wishlist Page	Adding/removing items to wishlist

Note: I wrote 50+ manual test cases covering all modules, and executed at least one test case per module to demonstrate functionality.

📝 Manual Test Cases

-50+ test cases created for major modules
-Covers positive, negative, and boundary scenarios
-Documented in Excel with steps, expected results, and status
-Demonstrates planning and QA methodology skills

💻 Automation Framework Highlights

-Follows Page Object Model (POM) for structured and maintainable code
-TestNG suite execution for batch testing
-Maven project for dependency management and build
-Screenshots captured for failures (stored in Screenshots folder)

HTML test reports generated after execution (stored in reports folder)
